# Going Solar: Activation

This is part of an [ongoing essay](/v2/solar/) detailing my experiences with solar energy. To see if solar is right for you, visit [SunPower](http://mbsy.co/sunpower/alexsolar).

## The Waiting Game

Just because the system is installed and the panels are collecting the sun's energy, that doesn't mean the electricity generated is going anywhere. The system still needs to be activated (or energized, in BGE parlance).

Before the system can be activated, both the building structure and electrical modifications need to be reviewed by a county inspector. Once inspected, a copy of the inspection certificate will be sent to BGE along with certificate of completion and a request for a net meter.

Once the net meter is installed and I get the OK from BGE, I get to flip [the switch](https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/15957424891/in/set-72157649099138418) and start sending excess electricity back to the grid.

## Activation Day

BGE came to install the net meter on January 5th, 2015. After jotting down the current reading on the (old) meter, the technician popped the old metter off and popped the new meter into place. Electricity to the house was out for about five seconds during the exchange, and afterward the net meter read 00000 kWh.

The system was first energized on January 6th, 2015.

## After Activation

Just before activation, [Solar Energy World](http://www.solarenergyworld.com) pre-registered me for SREC payment processing with [Sol Systems](http://www.solsystems.com/). Sol Systems required copies of the Interconnect agreement as well as a short contract to trade SRECs on my behalf; all easily handled.

After I made my final payment, Solar Energy World applied for my Maryland grant. They also sent me a warranty booklet.
