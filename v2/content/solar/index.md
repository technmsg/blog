# Going Solar

This is my story.

I first looked at solar power in 2012. I requested a consultation from [One Block Off the Grid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Block_Off_the_Grid) but then became overwhelmed by career changes; the company has since been acquired by [Pure Energies](http://pureenergies.com/), so perhaps it was a good thing I didn't follow through. Oddly enough and slightly tangential, Pure Energies contacted me via email after my system was installed.

I don't know why I started looking again.

A friend of mine had gotten solar panels and the technology piqued my interest. I also liked the notion of reducing my energy footprint, my impact on the surrounding grid, and not having large electric bills.

This time around I followed through.

If you aren't interested in the story or contract details, the system specifications, price, and ongoing costs are detailed in [The Bottom Line](/v2/solar/solar-ongoing.html).

On with the story...

## Parting Thoughts

From signing the contract it took 90 days before I could throw the breaker and start generating electricity.

One of the things I liked is that the process was very hands-off. Aside from signing the contract, writing a few checks, and sending an email here and there, [Solar Energy World](http://www.solarenergyworld.com/) took care of everything else: filing for permits, interconnect application, SREC registration, etc. If you're in the market, give SEW a look, and let 'em know I referred you.

Given the expected reduction in my utility bills and all the incentives, the expected break-even point is 6-7 years, after which point I have a fixed effective price per kWh for the bulk of my electric needs. Like any investment, there's the possibility it might not pan out, but I'm hoping. We'll see.
