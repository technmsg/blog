# Going Solar: Paperwork

This is part of an [ongoing essay](/v2/solar/) detailing my experiences with solar energy. To see if solar is right for you, visit [SunPower](http://mbsy.co/sunpower/alexsolar).

## Paperwork

While there *was* paperwork involved with getting solar panels installed, it wasn't too bad; far less that buying a car. And far easier to read, too.

Unless you're actively considering solar, this will probably be rather boring. Feel free to skip straight to [the system details](/v2/solar/solar-system.html).

### Contract

After deciding to purchase a system outright, I signed a contract with [Solar Energy World](http://www.solarenergyworld.com).

Their contract is 3 pages, delivered in paper/carbon form. It outlines the type and size system to be installed, the cost, the payment structure, and responsibilities of each party.

The vendors may have a good idea of how their contracts and installs progress, but it's usually the customer's first time, and I routinely experience the weird edge cases where I get hosed. I made several modifications to protect myself from unnecessary costs:

1. shifted responsibility to SEW for costs associated with HOA approvals and variances, also removed a termination clause should I not receive the same
2. changed payment terms - initial deposit at contract signing, second payment after design approval and HOA approval, balance at "substantial completion"
3. revised cancelation points
4. removed limitation of permit costs that SEW would bear

Additionally I created an addendum to the terms and conditions to add additional coverage (some of which was inspired by the Solar City contract) and to further define things that I wasn't clear on:

1. defined "substantial completion" to mean the system would be installed, fully operational, and pass satisfactory building and electrical inspections; the thought was that my final payment was due *after* I received approval to flip the switch and I could verify proper operation, although in actuality I'd have to wait a little longer for BGE to provide the net meter
2. added explicit 5-year roof warranty due to roof penetrations associated with the install; according to my sales rep they've never had a leak, but it made me feel better
3. shifted bulk of arbitration costs to SEW; seemed more fair that they bear the cost if they insist on arbitration
4. added additional right to cancel up until the point construction began on the home; I wanted an out just in case my HOA nixed the plan
5. added explicit 25-year power production guarantee with agreed-upon annual kWh figures and price/kWh reimbursement pricing and schedule, adjusted for expected market increases; this was an idea I got from the Solar City contract, modified slightly
6. added removal/replacement clause, should I need to move or replace the roof; also inspired by the Solar City contract

My representative Sean was very patient, met with me several times to collaborate, and we quickly came to a suitable agreement to serve both our needs.

### Site Inspection

Initial sizing is usually done via Google Maps or Google Earth, but after a contract is signed the physical property needs to be inspected and assessed.

Rafael came to perform the site inspection. He took photos of my electrical panel, [with](https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/15915811906/in/set-72157649099138418) and [without](https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/15959222482/in/set-72157649099138418) the cover. He went to the attic and measured the roof trusses. He also got up onto the roof and took detailed measurements, including the dimension and position of furnace and dryer vents. The site inspection took about an hour.

The data from the inspection was used to design and draw up engineering schematics for the system.

### System Design

Five (5) days after the site inspection, the system design was emailed to me.

The system design consists of a CAD drawing and a PV Design Report, which outline how much energy will be captured by the panels in their configuration (as affected by position of the sun, panel type, shade points, time of year, etc). Over the course of its 25-year service life, the system is estimated to produce 4,348-4,804 kWh per year (or 362-400 kWh per month), representing 75-80% of my usage.

A simple "I agree" reply via email constituted my approval.

### Grant Application

Solar Energy World mailed me the Grant Application for one of the Maryland incentives, mostly pre-filled for me, which I signed and returned.

### Interconnect Application

Solar Energy World mailed me the Interconnect application for BGE (my utility company) mostly pre-filled for me, which I completed, signed, and returned to SEW. With approval, I'll be able to backfeed electricity back onto the grid. BGE contacted me twelve (12) days later with approval, but cautioned that the system should not be energized until the net meter is put into place.

While the system would work and provide electricity to the home without the net meter (as demonstrated during testing), you'd be billed for overproduction instead of credited.

### HOA

In Maryland, an HOA can't prevent a homeowner from installing solar panels on their property (it's a legally protected thing thanks to [solar easements and rights laws](http://programs.dsireusa.org/system/program/detail/3)) but they can (and mine will) fine you for not following the bylaws of the association (i.e. not filling out an application).

I filled out a Modification Application for my homeowner's association, got the signatures of two neighbors (who seemed more interested than perturbed), and sent it to SEW for completion.

SEW put that application together with the design plan, some brochures on the specifics panels, and sent it off to my HOA's Modifications Committee for review. The HOA approved my application 15 days after they received the materials from SEW.
