# Going Solar: Frequently Asked Questions

This is part of an [ongoing essay](/v2/solar/) detailing my experiences with solar energy.

Whether solar pays off for me or what its place in the energy market will be in the future, one thing is clear: many people have questions about solar. Throughout my solar journey, I've addressed a variety of questions.

Here are some of the questions that weren't answered elsewhere.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What was your electric bill like before?**

In 2014, my average electric usage was 450 kWh per month.

My electrical usage rises and falls with the seasons, rising in the warmer months when I use air conditioning and falling in the colder months when I use natural gas for heating.

**Q: What happens if the panels are damaged by hail?**

I carry enough coverage on my homeowner's insurance policy to cover the replacement cost of the system.

**Q: Do you have to clean the panels?**

In theory, yes, since dirty panels can decrease the efficiency of the PV cells. In practice, most people don't, particularly when the panels are accessible without a ladder and safety harness. Rain is a natural cleaning agent. I intend to let it work for me.

The pitch and elevation of my roof are both considerable (and a bit scary). Combined with the dark color of the panels, the system should be somewhat resistant to snowfall. There have been some stories about owners climbing onto their roofs to clean their panels after a snowstorm, but that won't be me. My health is far more important than saving a few bucks.

**Q: What about upkeep?**

None so far.

**Q: What direction do the panels face?**

The roof (and panels) face southwest, give or take a few degrees.

**Q: What happens when it rains?**

As [SEIA points out](http://www.seia.org/about/solar-energy/solar-faq/what-happens-solar-panels-when-it%E2%80%99s-cloudy-or-raining) in their article:

> Photovoltaic panels can use direct or indirect sunlight to generate power, though they are most effective in direct sunlight. Solar panels will still work even when the light is reflected or partially blocked by clouds. Rain actually helps to keep your panels operating efficiently by washing away any dust or dirt

I can confirm that production [slows on a rainy day](https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/16266401982), but doesn't usually cease unless it's *severely* overcast.

**Q: What happens when it snows?**

If we receive a light dusting of snow, solar production doesn't seem to be affected too much. Both flurries and mild accumulation seem to melt quickly; the overcast conditions seem to have a bigger impact than the precipitation.

Production definitely ceases when the panels are thoroughly covered in snow. After a few inches accumulation [it takes a bit longer for the snow to melt](https://www.flickr.com/photos/techmsg/16064044529/), particularly if the temperature stays below freezing. After heavier storms the snow doesn't melt at all, rather the weight of the snow reaches critical mass and slides off the panels.

I don't make any efforts to remove snow from the panels.

Research has indicated that [light reflected off snow-covered ground can actually boost production](http://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/are-solar-panels-usable-in-sno/21894748), although I haven't seen this yet.
