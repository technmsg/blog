# Affiliate Programs

I have agreements with the following affiliate marketing programs.

## Amazon

**As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.**

I'm a participant in the [Amazon Services LLC Associates Program](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/), an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to [amazon.com](https://www.amazon.com?tag=v2mdc-20).

In others words, if I link to a product on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com?tag=v2mdc-20) the link includes an Associate ID code, so if you follow it and buy the product -- or anything else, from a [Canon 70D](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DMS0GTC/?tag=v2mdc-20) to [cat litter](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ANC83U/?tag=v2mdc-20) to [books on Hadoop Security](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491900989/?tag=v2mdc-20) -- I might make a few bucks. I don't have any means to know who purchased what.

Is this new?

No.

My participation in the Amazon Associates program has always been clearly stated on the [Errata](/v2/errata.html) page, but recent [Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidance](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/ftcs-endorsement-guides-what-people-are-asking#affiliate) has stipulated that the nature of affiliate relationships needs to be more transparent. Amazon, for their part, has mandated that the statement above appear "clearly and conspicuously" on the site.

As of October 2020, the aforementioned statement will appear atop any page with affiliate links and link to this page.

## SunPower

I'm a participant in the [SunPower Referral](https://us.sunpower.com/refer-friends-and-family/) program. I earn a small reward fee when qualified homeowners have an in-home consultation with [SunPower](https://tinyurl.com/y34p2jhu) after signing up using one of the respective links on the site.
